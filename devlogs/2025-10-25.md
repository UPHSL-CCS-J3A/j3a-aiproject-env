# Devlog: 2025-10-25 — Posture Detection (Calibration-Based)

## What I did
- Created a real-time posture detection system using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe Pose**.
- Implemented a **calibration feature** using the `'C'` key to set the reference posture.
- Calculated the **vertical distance between the nose and shoulder line** to detect posture accuracy.
- Added visual feedback with color indicators:
  - Green → good posture
  - Red → bad posture
- Added keyboard controls:
  - `'C'` → calibrate
  - `'R'` → recalibrate
  - `'Q'` → quit

## What went well
- Pose tracking using MediaPipe worked smoothly and consistently.
- Recalibration (`'R'`) functioned correctly.
- Distance-based posture detection is stable after calibration.
- Visual feedback clearly shows the posture status in real time.

## Issues encountered
- During the demo, both `'C'` and `'Q'` keys **did not respond**, likely due to **device or input hardware issues** rather than code logic.
- Requires further testing on other devices to confirm the cause.

## What needs improvement
- Add on-screen or console confirmation after calibration (e.g., “Calibrated successfully!”).
- Improve input reliability by checking `cv2.waitKey()` handling on different systems.
- Could integrate additional posture metrics (like shoulder tilt or neck angle) for more accuracy.

## Next steps
- Implement sound or visual alerts for posture correction.
- Add adaptive thresholding based on body proportions or camera distance.
- Log posture data for session tracking and analysis.

## Expected Output
Displays webcam feed with pose lines and text overlay:
- Green text: “GOOD POSTURE”
- Red text: “BAD POSTURE”
- White text for nose–shoulder distance and calibration instructions.
